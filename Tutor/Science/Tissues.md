### What are Tissues ?

Tissue is a feature of multicellular organisms... **A group of cells having similar shape and function act together to perform a specific function** is known as a tissue. Blood, phloem and muscle are all examples of tissues.

#### What is the uses of tissues in multi-cellular organisms?

The use of tissues in multicellular organisms is to provide structural and mechanical strength as well as mallow division of labour.

#### Types of Tissues in Plants?

- ##### **MERISTEMATIC TISSUE -** *Meristematic tissue is the plant tissue that has the ability to divide actively throughout its life*

- **PERMANENT TISSUE -** *Cells that had formed by Meristematic Tissue but **lost** their ability to divide further. **Simple Permanent Tissue & Complex Permanent Tissue** are it's types.*
  
    - **Simple Permanent Tissue -**
      
        - only one type of cell.
        - similar and same type structure.
        - parenchyma, \[collenchyma\](provide flexibility in plants thus they dont break easily), and \[sclerenchyma\]( which makes the plant hard and stiff eg. coconut) are it's main types.
    - ##### **Complex Permanent Tissue -**
      
        - Same structure.
        - Dissimilar cells.
        - perform common function.
        - Xylem and phloem are examples

#### Name the tissue responsible for movement of our body ?

Muscular tissue & Nervous tissue.

#### What do we understand by Neuron ?

A cell that communicates with other cells via specialized connections called synapses. Plants and fungi don't have these nerve cells.

#### Give three features of cardiac muscles ?

The cardiac muscles are specialized tissues that are evolved to pump blood throughout the body.

- They are cylindrical in shape.
  
- Striated muscle fibers.
  
- They are uninucleated and branched.
  
- These muscles are involuntary in nature.
  

#### What are the functions of Areolar tissue?

The functions of areolar connective tissue include **the support and binding of other tissues**. It also helps in defending against infection.

**Diagrammatically show the difference between the three types of muscle fibers.**

1.  Cardiac muscles

- Present in the heart.
  
- Involuntary in nature.
  
- They have 1 nucleus.
  
- The muscle fibers are branched.

2.  Smooth muscles
    
    - Found in lungs and alimentary canal.
      
    - Involuntary in nature.
      
    - They have 1 nucleus.
      
    - They are spindle shaped.

3.  Striated muscles
    
    - They are connected with bones
      
    - Voluntary in nature.
      
    - They are long and cylindrical muscle fibers.
      
    - They possess many nuclei.
      
    - Striated muscles are unbranched.

#### **What is the specific function of the cardiac muscle?**

The cardiac muscles are branched and cylindrical. They are uninucleated and are involuntary in nature. Throughout one’s lifetime, the cardiac muscles bring about the rhythmic contraction and relaxation.

* * *

**Differentiate between striated, un-striated and cardiac muscles on the basis of their structure and site/location in the body.**

The following are the differences between different types of muscles based on their structure and location in the body.

| **Character** | **Striated muscles** | **Un-striated muscles** | **Cardiac muscles** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shape/Structure | Long, cylindrical, non – tapering.They are un-branched. | Long and tapering.They are un – branched. | Cylindrical and non – tapering.They are branched. |
| Location in body | Hands, legs and skeletal muscles | Wall of stomach, intestine, ureter and bronchi | Heart |
| Dark and light bands | Present | Absent | Present but less prominent |

**Draw a labelled diagram of a neuron.**

Diagram of a neuron along with the labelling is as follows:

* * *

(a) Tissue that forms the inner lining of our mouth – The epithelial tissue, Squamous epithelium.

(b) Tissue that connects muscle to bone in humans – Tendon

(c) Tissue that transports food in plants – Phloem

(d) Tissue that stores fat in our body – Adipose tissue

(e) Connective tissue with a fluid matrix – Blood, it is a fluid connective tissue

(f) Tissue present in the brain – Nervous tissue

* * *

#### **Identify the type of tissue in the following :**

**Skin, bark of tree, bone, lining of kidney tubule, vascular bundle.**

➢ Skin: Striated squamous epithelial tissue

➢ Bark of tree: Protective tissue and cork

➢ Bone: Connective tissue

➢ Lining of kidney tubule: Cuboidal epithelial tissue

➢ Vascular bundle: Conducting tissue(xylem and phloem). Complex permanent tissue

#### **Name the regions in which parenchyma tissue is present.**

The parenchyma is found in:

- The pith of stems and roots
- When parenchyma contains chlorophyll it is called as chlorenchyma, it is found in green leaves
- Parenchyma found in aquatic plants has large air cavities which enables them to float and are hence called aerenchyma.

#### **What is the role of epidermis in plants?**

The epidermis in plants forms an uninterrupted and continuous layer that has no intercellular spaces. It provides protection.

* * *

#### **How does the cork act as a protective tissue?**

Cork cells are dead. The arrangement of cells is so dense, that there is no intercellular space. Deposition of suberin is observed on the walls of the cells that make them impervious to water and gases.

#### **Complete the following chart.**
