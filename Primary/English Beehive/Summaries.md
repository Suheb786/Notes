> The story begins with two children named, Margie and Tommy. It takes place in the world of the future where computers dominate everything. Moreover, it also shows how the concept of schools and classrooms has transformed completely.
>
> It’s the year 2157, and Margie is writing in her diary about how Tommy found a book. This book was of Tommy’s grandfather when he was a little kid. Margie learns about how they use to print all the stories on paper back then.
>
> Further, they read the book themselves and find the feeling of turning pages over rather funny. It was funny because they were not in the habit of reading still words, only ones in motion that too on a screen. We learn that in the future, there are no books, only tele-books. They store them in TV sets and computers.
>
> After that, it takes an interesting turn when they discuss school. Margie learns that schools were very different back then. They had actual persons who were teachers. It is surprising because she has only robots which teach her.
>
> Moreover, she does not like school because of a lot of reasons. The school she studies does not have any classmates. In fact, it doesn’t even have recess or playground.
>
> Margie and Tommy study in a virtual classroom. They have robots as teachers. Most importantly, her ‘school’ is next to her bedroom only. It is a room full of electronics, robots, and gadgets. The computer software teaches her everything.
>
> When Margie attends her school after learning about the earlier ones, she starts wondering. When she starts studying, she cannot help but think about the earlier days.
>
> Margie wonders about the fun her grandparents would indulge in. She imagined kids from different neighborhoods coming together merrily to attend school.
>
> Moreover, the fact that they were taught the same thing amused her. It was because everyone would help each other out with the homework. Thus, in the end, she is left wondering about the fun they had.

> This poem talks about the choices that one has to make in life and their consequences. One day, while walking in a wooded area full of trees with yellow leaves, the poet comes to a fork in the road and has to decide which road he should take. 
>
> He starts debating over the choice as he realizes he cannot walk on both. The second road appears to be less travelled and he is tempted to walk on it even though the first path also appears to have been left undisturbed for some time. 
>
> However, he decides to take the second path with the intention of walking on the first one sometime in the future.
>
> At the same time he knows that the chances of his returning that way are slim, especially as he is aware of the manner in which one path leads on to the other, taking the traveller far away from the main path. 
>
> In the last stanza, the poet becomes philosophical when he talks about a future time when he would look back at the choices that he has made in life and their consequences. He feels his life will be very different from others because he has always been tempted to take the path that is not generally followed by others. 
>
> It shows the poet as an adventurous man ready to take risks in life. He does not appear to like following the conventional path.
>
> The mood of the poem is philosophical and thoughtful as the narrator wonders whether his choice of the road he decided to travel upon had been the right one.

> *The story of a girl who could feel music.*
>
> Evelyn Glennie was deaf. She was seventeen years old and was nervous as it was her first day at the prestigious Royal Academy of Music in London. Being deaf was a challenge for her. Evelyn became deaf gradually because, according to her mother, she could barely hear at the age of eight, and year after year, she became deaf. She suffered from severe nerve damage.
>
> Evelyn’s obsession with music encouraged her to play the xylophone. All the teachers discouraged her because of her hearing problem, but Ron Forbes (a percussionist and her teacher) helped her learn to sense music vibration with her body. She was a huge success all across the United Kingdom. She switched to solo performances at the age of sixteen and secured one of the highest marks in the Royal Academy of Music in London.
>
> She became the world’s most sought-after percussionist and could play multiple musical instruments. She also learned French and Japanese. Music tingled her skin and hairs. She also used to remove her shoes while playing to sense the coming vibrations of sound waves.
>
> She was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society’s prestigious Soloist of the Year Award. She gave free performances in prisons and hospitals. Evelyn was an inspiration for thousands and millions of disabled people all over the world.

The second part of the chapter **portrays the journey of Bismillah Khan**. Bismillah Khan was a maestro in 'Shehnai'. The history of Shehnai says that Emperor Aurangzeb banned the playing of the instrument 'Pungi' because of its unpleasant sound.

> The lesson beautifully deals with the early life of Bismillah khan in Dumraon in Bihar. His grandfather was a shehnai-nawaz of the bhojpur king’s court. Bismillah khan took to music early in life when he was 3 years old in the company of his maternal uncle. 
>
> His life is a source of simplicity and communal harmony from the very beginning when he used to sing ‘ Chiata’ in Bihariji temple and practicing shehnai in Vishnu temple and Mangala Maiya temple of Varanasi. 
>
> Bismillah khan got his big break with the opening of All India Radio in Lucknow in 1938. He also played shehnai on 15 August, 1947 from Red fort in presence of Pandit Nehru. 
> Bismillah khan gave many memorable performances both in India and abroad where he was honoured with so many awards. He also gave music in two movies ‘Gunj Uthi shehnai’ and ‘Sanadhi Apanna”. 
>
> He was so fond of his motherland India, Benaras and the holy Ganga that he refused an offer to be the Head of Shehnai school in USA. In 2001, Ustad Bismillah khan was awarded India’s highest civilian avard, the Bharat Ratna. In the end, his life is a perfect example of the rich, cultural heritage of India, one that effortlessly accepts that a devout Muslim like him can very naturally play the shehnai at the Kashi Vishwanath Temple

> The narrator’s Grandfather was very fond of animals. He had a nice collection of animals such as a tortoise, a tame squirrel, a pair of rabbits and a goat. But he didn’t have a monkey. So, one day, he bought a baby monkey from a tonga-driver and named it Toto. Toto’s arrival not only gladdened him but also enriched his private zoo.
>
> Toto was an attractive monkey with sparkling eyes and pearl white teeth. He would take special delight in scaring elderly Anglo-Indian ladies. His tail added to his good look, and also served as a third hand. Since Grandmother did not have any interest in animals, she never welcomed grandfather with a new bird or animal in the house.
>
> So, it was decided that Toto’s presence should be kept a secret until Grandmother was in a good mood.
>
> Toto was temporarily kept in a little closet opening into the narrator’s bedroom wall, where he was tied securely to a peg fastened into the wall. Being mischievous by nature, Toto began to create a nuisance from the very first day. He removed the ornamental wallpaper, pulled out the peg and tore off the narrator’s blazer. Grandfather was quite happy to see Toto’s performance.
>
> Toto was now transferred to a big cage in the servants’ quarters where Grandfather’s other animals lived together. But Toto would create troubles for them. He did not let them sleep peacefully. His pernicious activities were increasing day by day.
>
> So when Grandfather had to go to Saharanpur to collect his pension, he carried Toto with him in a big black canvas kit-bag. Since there was no opening in the bag to allow his hands or face to come out, he would often jump inside the bag, making the bag roll about on the floor of the Dehradun railway platform.
>
> On reaching Saharanpur Toto was caught by the ticket-collector who classified him as a dog so that Grandfather had to pay for his (Toto’s) fare.
>
> Toto was finally accepted by the Grandmother. He was then shifted to the stable, where Nana, the family donkey lived. But Toto continued teasing her as a result of which they could never become friends.
>
> Toto loved to take bath in hot water in winter. One day, he nearly succeeded in boiling himself alive by jumping in a large kitchen kettle that had been left on the fire to boil for tea. It was Grandmother who came to his rescue and saved him.
>
> Toto continued his antics by tearing clothes to shreds, breaking plated and other utensils. Everyone in the family got fed up with his mischievous activities. Even Grandfather began to think seriously about him. And finally he took a hard decision to get rid of the monkey. He found the tonga-driver and sold Toto back to him for only three rupees.
